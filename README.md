# Java vs Python
This is a test to see which language is faster in determining if a number is prime or not.

-----

The code for each file essentially attempts to recursively determine if a number is prime or not.
* The numbers range from 1 to 104729.

-----

This is the table showing the time in milliseconds it takes for each language to go through the list of numbers;

| Java Time (ms) | Python Time (ms) |
|:---------:|:-----------:|
| 18        | 886.76      |
| 18        | 880.22      |
| 17        | 899.62      |
| 18        | 877.31      |
| 18        | 934.35      |
